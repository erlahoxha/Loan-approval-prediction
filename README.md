# ðŸ’° Loan Approval Prediction with k-Nearest Neighbors

> An end-to-end kNN pipeline for forecasting loan approval outcomes, showcasing rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Using the Kaggle Loan Approval Classification dataset, this project demonstrates how to:

1. **Ingest & clean** demographic and financial data  
2. **Label-encode** categorical variables and standardize numeric features  
3. **Train** kNN classifiers for multiple k values  
4. **Evaluate** performance through accuracy metrics and confusion matrices

## ðŸ“Š Sample Results

| k-Value | Test Accuracy |
|:-------:|--------------:|
|    3    |        81.2 % |
|    5    |        83.5 % |
|    7    |     **85.0 %** |

> **Key Insight:**  
> A neighborhood size of **k = 7** strikes the optimal balance between bias and variance, achieving **85.0 %** accuracy in predicting loan approval.
